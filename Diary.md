So ... where to start? 

How about a overview of the data? 

Here are some perspectives to explore and potential solutions: 
(1) General description: total number of people of each day, etc. 
(2) What is the impact of some factors: holiday or weekend, weather, etc? 
(3) How do people move to the mountain top? I can extract some people with more data to track their path. 

Let's begin.

Have done a very very basic analysis that covers many aspects of the data. 
Had a discussion with the professors. 
The things I need to do next are twofold: to learn discrete choice model (so, go back to logit again ... too difficult for me); to think about the specific question.

Read some articles and sections of textbooks about discrete model ... haven't understand the model yet. But maybe I can try to apply the model (which is not a good manner though) or collect the data required for the potential model first.
